## Hello there 👋🏽 - I'm Thiago

- I'm currently working as a Backend Engineer with the focus on the creation of REST API's, Crawlers and Routines
- Recently, I have beeen working with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). I've also been experimenting with [Nest](https://nestjs.com/) and have built some API's with it.
- When it comes to infrastructure, I have experience with: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
- As for continuous delivery: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/).
- I have great experience in creating integrations with third part services the most recently being [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/)
- I speak portuguese and english
- I develop games as a hobby from time to time using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- I have a little [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBtn_AbhzI1tjXMMqTsVSw) in wich I post some programming tutorials (usually stuff that I wish somebody explained better when I was learning)

> My repositories are a little out of date since I'm working full time and have some personal (not programming related) projects going on, but I'm planning in developing some projects to put here to illustrate the current status of my development expertise.
