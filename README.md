I'm a _Fullstack Developer_ and by Fullstack I mean _"Backend developer who can get around frontend if necessary"_.

### Languages:
- Portuguese (Native)
- English (Fluent)

### Hobbies

In my free time, you'd usually find me playing with my daughter, playing some old games on one of the retro devices that I have
or debugging something that went wrong in one of my overly complicated solutions for my home devices.
